What the Percentiles Mean (Explain This to Students)
    50% → average engineer in the market
    70% → solid but replaceable
    80%+ → trusted with real systems
    90%+ → rare skill combination

SEIR → SEIR-I graduates consistently sit above the average candidate pool because:
    Most engineers know infrastructure OR identity
    Very few know both
    Even fewer can recover calmly when identity breaks

Why This Combination Is Powerful

| SEIR Gives You          | SEIR-I Adds                   |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Infrastructure judgment | Trust & access judgment       |
| DevOps & automation     | Federation & recovery         |
| CI/CD discipline        | Identity blast-radius control |
| Debugging systems       | Debugging trust failures      |

Together, this means:
You don’t just deploy systems — you control who can touch them and why.

Global / Remote Salary Reality
| Region                       | Typical Range (USD) |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Western Europe               | $110k – $150k       |
| LATAM (Top-tier remote)      | $95k – $135k        |
| Asia-Pacific (Senior remote) | $105k – $145k       |

Identity skills travel extremely well because every enterprise needs them.
